## The Curious Side  
Outside the world of data and code, I stay inspired by mystery, stories, and exploration:  

📚 Diving into novels and uncovering hidden twists  
🕵️‍♀️ My love for mystery is what drives me in **data mining**—every dataset feels like a puzzle waiting to be solved  
🎨 I enjoy creative thinking and continuous learning, seeing patterns not just in numbers but in life itself  

For me, **Data Science is storytelling**—finding the hidden narrative inside the chaos of information, and turning it into something clear and meaningful.  

*"Curiosity isn’t just my habit—it’s my strength."*
